This is a rep to store my fyp (final year project) code. 

I don't care if ppl see it so i didn't make it private, but this code is def not ideal and should not be used as referance.

It's more of a place to store iterations and attempts so i don't have to undo a 1000 times to see how changes compare to each other

also this is a good opertunity for me to learn how to use github


The project uses EIS data to predict the prescence of dengue and later on i'll use gans and vaes to create fake data
